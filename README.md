# RemindMe! Bot

Reply to any skeet with "RemindMe! # years, # months, # weeks, # days, # hours, # minutes" and the bot will remind you after that time has passed by replying to you!

The `remindme` command is not case-sensitive, and will work with the exclamation mark before or after the command

Built using my Bluesky event handlers package: [Bsky-event-handlers](https://github.com/juni-b-queer/bsky-event-handlers). 
It can be used to make almost any simple reply bot, and was designed to be intentionally expandable and extendable to make even complex bots simple.

Uh? sure? Feel free to open a PR if you have any thoughts or ideas for how this could be improved. I'm planning on 
updating some of the functions and handlers to make it more readable and optimized. I don't like how I'm flattening/normalizing
text right now so that'll be a future change when I get to it.

But anyway, feel free to open issues or PRs! Thanks!
