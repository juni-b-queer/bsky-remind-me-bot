# RemindMe! Bot
Use the command `!remindme` or `remindme!` (case-insensitive) followed by a timestamp (`12/24/2024 at 12PM`) or additive time (`2 months and 1 day`) to set a reminder, and the bot will remind you at that time!\
Add a timezone at the end to make sure the reminder is at the right time for YOU!\
The `remindme` command is not case-sensitive, and will work with the exclamation mark before or after the command

Built using my [bsky-event-handlers](https://github.com/juni-b-queer/bsky-event-handlers) package and my [time-decoding-utils](https://github.com/juni-b-queer/time-decoding-utils) package\
It can be used to make almost any simple reply bot, and was designed to be intentionally expandable and extendable to make even complex bots simple.
## Contribute
Uh? sure? Feel free to open a PR if you have any thoughts or ideas for how this could be improved. I'm planning on 
updating some of the functions and handlers to make it more readable and optimized. I don't like how I'm flattening/normalizing
text right now so that'll be a future change when I get to it.

But anyway, feel free to open issues or PRs! Thanks!
